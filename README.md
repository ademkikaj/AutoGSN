# Project Descripton

This project includes three different subprojects:

-   A frequent subgraph mining project based on [gSpan](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1184038&casa_token=hII_fVgAeycAAAAA:bc095z3FKW0KFzRYjy1yIcNp7jIKEy9jXd_9cv4FxosnXtFOkIHTkcy0cS8VJqrUK52z7aHIzw&tag=1)
-   A discriminative subgraph mining project based on [GAIA](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1807167.1807262?casa_token=G-mvu1_NCJgAAAAA:4ToovRUGv-i_YrmH8SxNQP15J3hTY-N0rq49oNgp1h45khNM6c3cgwcQjKGe66q-05jZeFXg8Kfr)
-   A `pytorch` environment that encodes features (preprocesses graph data) produced by `gSpan` and `GAIA` and trains on processed data

# Experiments

## 1. Generating Relational Features

### Preparing data for gSpan

Since we use TUD Benchmark, we need to convert TUD data to [Networkx](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/index.html) data. To do so run the following command within the `pytorch` project.

```bash
# python utilities/convert.py -d {dataset_name}
# for example if we want to convert MUTAG to Networkx, run the following
python utilities/convert.py -d MUTAG
```

This command will convert TUD to Networkx and it will save a `{dataset}.dat` file under `pytorch/data_networkx/{dataset}.dat`.

Next, copy the generated `{dataset}.dat` file to `gspan/data_nx/{dataset}/{dataset}.dat`. Well-known dataset `MUTAG` already exists as an example.

Next we have to convert `networkx` data to a specific format that can be used with `gSpan`. To do so run the following command within the `gSpan` project.

```bash
# python utilities/nx_to_graph.py -d {dataset_name}
# for example if we want to convert MUTAG to Networkx, run the following
python utilities/nx_to_graph.py -d MUTAG
```

This will produce a `{dataset}.graph` file under `gspan/data_graph/{dataset}.graph`.

### Mining Subgraphs with gSpan

Now that we have `.graph` data we can generate relational features by running the following command within the `gspan` project.

```bash
# python app.py -d {dataset_name} -s {support_in_percentage} -n {length_of_dataset/nr_of_graphs}
# for example if we want to generate subgraphs of MUTAG with 90%, run the following
python app.py -d MUTAG -s 90 -n 188
```

This command should generate 13 subgraphs and save them under `/data_nx_features/{dataset_support}.dat`.

### Mining Discriminative Subgraphs with GAIA

To generate files that are used as an input for `GAIA` software, run the following command withing the `pytorch` environment. This command with automatically convert `TUD` datasets to a specific format used in `GAIA`. Two files will be generated `{dataset_name}_node_file.txt` and `{dataset_name}_edge_file.txt`.

```bash
# python utilities/tud_to_gaia.py -d {dataset_name}
# for example if we want to convert MUTAG to GAIA, run the following
python utilities/tud_to_gaia.py -d MUTAG
```

Once the files are ready, move them to `GAIA` directory and follow the instructions on how to use `GAIA`.

For `MUTAG` dataset `GAIA` should generate six discriminative features. Generated features are save in a file under the name `patternResult.txt`. Now, to convert these features to `Networkx` format move the file under `gspan/data_gaia/{dataset_name}/patternResult.txt` and run the following command within the `gspan` environment:

```bash
# python gaia_to_nx.py -d {dataset_name} -nf {nr_of_node_features/node_labels}
# for example if for MUTAG, we have 7 node features
python gaia_to_nx.py -d MUTAG -nf 7
```

This command will create a new file under `gspan/data_gaia/{dataset_name}/{dataset_name}_gaia_nx.dat`.

## 2. Preprocessing TUD datasets and Training

### Creating an experiment

First, under `pytorch/experiments/` create a folder following your dataset name, e.g. `pytorch/experiments/MUTAG`. Inside this folder add the following structure:

```
pytorch/
  experiments/
    MUTAG/
      data/
      features/
      results/
      config.json
```

The directories `data` and `results` will be automatically populated once the experiments are executed. Under the `features` add the file generated by `gSpan` that contains your features `{dataset_support}.dat`. For example:

```
pytorch/
  experiments/
    MUTAG/
      data/
      features/
        MUTAG_90.dat
      results/
      config.json
```

The same way add features generated by `GAIA`.

The `config.json` contains configuration about the model hyperparameters and data preprocessing. For example, if we want to encode relational features from the file `MUTAG_90.dat`, with and without labels, the following configuration should be provided.

```json
{
    "model": {
        "seed": 0,
        "batch_size": 32,
        "hidden_channel": 32,
        "learning_rate": 0.001,
        "layers": 4,
        "scheduler": true,
        "step_size": 50,
        "decay": 0.9,
        "dropout": 0.5,
        "folds": 10,
        "epochs": 351
    },
    "features": [
        {
            "name": "MUTAG_90",
            "labelled": false,
            "device": "cuda:0"
        },
        {
            "name": "MUTAG_90",
            "labelled": true,
            "device": "cuda:1"
        }
    ]
}
```

Once the `config.json` is ready, first preprocess the data by running the following command within `pytorch` project:

```bash
#python preprocess.py -d {experiment}
python preprocess.py -d MUTAG
```

This command will preprocess the data and provide the new processed dataset under the `pytorch/experiments/{dataset}/data/processed/`

Now to train, simply run the following command within `pytorch` project:

```bash
#python preprocess.py -d {experiment}
python train.py -d MUTAG
```

This command will train based on the configurations given in the `config.json` file of an experiment. This will generate results based on the dataset name under the `pytorch/experiments/{dataset}/results/{dataset}_{label}.json`.
